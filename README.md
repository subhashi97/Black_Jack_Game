Introduction :

Blackjack (also called "21") is a fun and enjoyable casino card game. As the name 21 implies, the object of the game is to come as close to 21 points as possible with your cards -- without going over -- and having a higher total than the dealer.

Here you can get a card by clicking the generate card button. If you want to take a card again you can click that button again. Your collection will appear on the screen. If the total is 21, you win and if the total is more than 21 you lose the bet. If you lose the game then restart button will be displayed and you can restart the game.
